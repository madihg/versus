## About

versus.exe is an AI poetry interface built with the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) and GPT 4.1, as part of an exhibition by [Halim Madi](https://www.halimmadi.com). This project explores the boundaries of computational creativity, channeling the visionary power of major English-language poets and the most innovative voices of the last 30 years.

- **Dataset:** Fine-tuned on a curated selection of modern and classical English poetry.
- **Exhibition:** Created for a live exhibition, not a course or tutorial. For more experiments at the intersection of language, art, and technology, follow [@halimmadi on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) and visit [halimmadi.com](https://www.halimmadi.com).
